## Reporting an urgent task 

If an urgent task is recognized by somebody within the dev-team, the following steps should be taken:

1. The recognizing person sends a mail to everybody in the dev-team over *urgent_ta5@mardi4nfdi.de* with "Dringend:" in the beginning of the subject line (Example "Dringend: Zertifikattimeout Morgen") This Mail contains information until when the task should be done. Also, it contains a reference to the GitHub-Issue with an accurate task description.
2. The current responsible person for urgent cases writes a response when the task will be solved as soon as possible. The responsibilities table (see below) defines which person is currently responsible.
